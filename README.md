**Stereo Network for Seismic Denoising**  
[Manuscript under review]

## Overview
Seismic records are often contaminated by random and coherent noise, making the recovery of weak reflection signals a challenging problem. This repository provides the implementation of the **Stereo Network**, a three-dimensional neural architecture that introduces a novel *height* dimension to enhance denoising performance while maintaining efficiency.

All datasets required to reproduce the results are openly available on Zenodo:
